_Learning Projects & Git/GitHub Practice_
This repository is my personal learning space where I:
1) Work on small coding projects and experiments.
2) Practice and explore Git commands (branching, merging, commits, etc.).
3) Learn how to use GitHub features (pull requests, issues, forking, etc.).
3) Keep track of my journey of learning coding, version control and project management.
